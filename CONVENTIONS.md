# o2.js **JavaScript** Conventions & Best Practices

## An **All-in-One** Guide to Writing Efficient **JavaScript** *;)*

**Last Updated**: *2012-06-07 08:17:03.197113*

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Bottom Line Up Front

Just carve this into your mind if you forget everything else you read in this
document:

> You should write your code that it can be read as good book.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Introduction

This document includes **JavaScript** usage and naming conventions, best
practices, and recommendations.

These conventions and recommendations are constantly being used within **o2.js**
source code, and examples.

If there's a particular **JavaScript** usage that's not mentioned in this
document:

* Either it should be proposed as an exceptional case and added to this
document.
* Or the code should be **re-factored** to adhere **o2.js** **JavaScript**
conventions.

This document is, in particular, the basis for **o2.js** coding standards.
In general, however, it *can* be used as a *guideline* for *any* large-scale
client-heavy **JavaScript** project.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Why Do We Need Conventions?

**Coding Conventions** is a must-have for any large-scale long-lived
software project.

> *Nearly %80 of the development time* in large-scale software projects go
> to **maintenance**, **patching**, and **rewriting** the codebase.

During their lifetime, these large-scale software projects are not coded
and maintained by one person, and everyone's coding style and preferences
differ.

In this essence, **coding conventions** constitute a shared language
between the developer team. They increase the readability of the code,
and make the code less error-prone.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## o2.js **JavaScript** Coding Standards

Here are the main code conventions, standards, and guidelines used
within **o2.js** source files:

### Maintain Existing Coding Style

This is easier to state, and harder to adhere.
Keep your coding habits and behaviors aside.
All code should look like a single person typed it, no matter how many
people contributed.


### Provide Tests for the Codebase

Any module developed SHOULD include some form of unit, reference,
implementation or functional testing. Use case demos DO NOT QUALIFY
as "tests".

### Code Cleanliness

The code should be kept clean. There should **not** be excessive logs,
debug lines, print statements, or alerts.

There should **not** be commented out code.

> The whole point of using a *version control system* is to eliminate the
> need of leaving commented out code in the source code. Instead of
> leaving the code commented out, one should utilize the version control
> system's *diff&merge* utility.

If there is a code piece that you long to keep, save it in an
external file **outside** the project folder.

### Line Length

To sustain code readability, limit the line length to **80 characters**.
If the line (*including the indentation*) exceeds **80 characters**,
continue from the next line.

### Indentation

Code blocks are indented with **4 spaces**. Each `<TAB>` corresponds to 4
spaces, and the actual `<TAB>` character is **NOT USED**. The IDE should be
set up to print **4 spaces** when pressing the `<TAB>` key.

Never mix spaces and tabs.

#### Indent...

* Statements within **blocks**:

        while (node) {
            if (node.nodeType != kTextNode) {
                return node;
            }

            node = node.nextSibling;
        }

* Statements within a **function** body:

        me.getNextById = function(target, id) {
            target = $(target);

            if (!target) {
                return null;
            }

            var node = target.nextSibling;

            if (!node) {
                return null;
            }

            var kTextNode = me.nodeType.TEXT;

            while (node) {
                if (node.id && node.id == id) {
                    return node;
                }

                // get the next node.
                node = node.nextSibling;
            }

            return null;
        };

* Statements within a **switch** body:

        switch(className) {
            case ccc.LOG:
                try {
                    console.log(text);
                } catch (ignore1) {
                }

                break;
            case ccc.INFO:
                try {
                    console.info(text);
                } catch (ignore2) {
                }

                break;

                ...

* Statements within a **case** body:

        ...

        case ccc.WARN:
            try {
                console.warn(text);
            } catch (ignore3) {
            }

            break;
        case ccc.ERROR:
            try {
                console.error(text);
            } catch (ignore4) {
            }

            break;
        default:
            try {
                console.log(text);
            } catch (ignore5) {
            }

            break;

* Statements **inside** a *closure*:

    Technically speaking, *any function* is also a *closure*. Therefore
    statements inside **any function** should be indented one level with
    respect to that *function*'s body.

        me.EventHandler.preventDefault = window.event ? function() {
            window.event.returnValue = false;

            return false;
        } : function(e) {
            if (!e) {
                return;
            }

            if (e.preventDefault) {
                e.preventDefault();
            }

            return false;
        };

        me.EventHandler.preventDefault(evt);

* Parts of the statement that are folded to the next line because they exceed
the **80 characters** line length limit:

        application.RenderController.repaintUserInfo(messageId, userId,
            options, callback); //<-- 1x indented.

#### Triple indent...

* Method parameters that are folded to the next line, and triple indented if
they exceed the **80 characters** line length limit.

    This will clearly indicate that those parameters are **not** a part of the
    function's body.

        var InstantChatMessageRenderer = {

            /*
             *
             */
            render : function(conversation, chatListItem, message,
                        timeStamp, messageId, userId) { //<-- 3x indented.
                prepareChatListItem(chatListItem, message,
                    (new Date()).getTime());

                conversation.appendChild(chatListItem);

                application.RenderController.repaintUserInfo(messageId,
                    userId); //<-- 1x indented.

                scrollToBottom(conversation);
            }
        };

* Similarly the conditional or expressional sections (i.e. the parts
that are evaluated) of `if`, `else`, `while`, `for`, `switch` statements are
folded to the next line and triple indendet if they exceed the **80 characters**
line length limit.

        ...
            if(src.nodeName.toLowerCase() === kTextarea &&
                        src.getAttribute(kDataInput)) { //<-- 3x indented.
                self = mentionsInputs[i];
                delegateClickAction(self);

                return;
            }
        ...

### Blank Lines

Blank lines may be used for separating  code lines or line groups semantically
for readability.

Leave **at most** one blank line.

Insert **one** blank line...

* **Before** *throw*, *break*, and *return* statements:

        if (!url) {
            stuff();

            return null;
        }


    **Exception**:

    If the *return*, *throw*, *break*... statement is the **only**
    statement within its block, then do not insert a blank line.

        if (!url) {
            return;
        }

* **After** function declerations:

        me.EventHandler.stopPropagation = function(e) {
            if (!e) {
                return;
            }

            e.stopPropagation();
        };

        me.EventHandler.stopPropagation(evt);

* **After** inline functions:

        function isArray(obj) {
            return is(obj, config.constants.ecmaScriptType.ARRAY);
        }

        function is(obj, type) {
            var objectNameStartIndex = 8;
            var trimLastBraceIndex = -1;
            var klass = Object.prototype.toString.call(obj).slice(
                objectNameStartIndex, trimLastBraceIndex);

            return (obj !== undefined) && (obj !== null) && (klass === type);
        }

* **Between** two **if** blocks:

        if (!ar) {
            return -1;
        }

        if (isArray(ar)) {
            for (var i = 0, len = ar.length; i < len; i++) {
                if (elm == ar[i]) {
                    return i;
                }
            }

            return -1;
        }

* **After** variable declerations:

        var nodeName = 'div';

        if (config.isUsingConsole && config.outputElement) {

            return function(value, className) {
                println(value, className);

                var debugContent = document.createElement(nodeName);

                debugContent.className = className;
                debugContent.innerHTML = value;
                config.outputElement.appendChild(debugContent);
            };

            ...

* **After** variable assignments:

        var test = null;

        if (someCondition()) {
            test = getTestValue();

            doStuff();
        }

* **Before** a *try/catch/finally* construct:

        function processCallbacks(xhr, callbacks) {
            doStuff();

            try {
                if (isSuccess) {
                    oncomplete(xhr.responseText, xhr.responseXML, xhr);

                    return;
                }

                onerror(xhr.status, xhr.statusText, xhr);
            } catch (ex) {
                onexception(xhr, ex);
            } finally {
                finalizeXhr(xhr);
            }
        }


    **Exception**:

    Do not insert a blank linke if that try/catch/finally is the only
    thing inside the block:

        function processCallbacks(xhr, callbacks) {
            try {
                if (isSuccess) {
                    oncomplete(xhr.responseText, xhr.responseXML, xhr);

                    return;
                }

                onerror(xhr.status, xhr.statusText, xhr);
            } catch (ex) {
                onexception(xhr, ex);
            } finally {
                finalizeXhr(xhr);
            }
        }

* **Before** *any* kind of *comment*:

        ...

        }

        /*
         * <p>Processes callbacks and finalizes the <code>Xhr</code>.</p>
         *
         * @param {XmlHttpRequest} xhr - the current <code>Xhr</code> instance.
         * @param {Object} callbacks - oncomplete, onerror and onexception
         * callbacks.
         */
        function processCallbacks(xhr, callbacks) {

        ...

        //
        parameters = parameters || {};
        callbacks = callbacks || {};
        isSync = !!isSync;

        var isAsync = !isSync;
        var kRandom = config.constants.prefix.RANDOM;
        var kGet = config.constants.verb.GET;
        var isPost = verb != kGet;

        // name1=value1&name2=value2&name3=value3
        var parametrizedQuery = generateParametrizeQueryString(parameters);

        // &name1=value1&name2=value2&name3=value3 (for GET requests)
        var query = isPost ? '' : ['&', parametrizedQuery].join('');

        // name1=value1&name2=value2&name3=value3 (for POST requests)
        var postQuery = isPost ? parametrizedQuery : '';

        // A unique string to prevent caching.
        var guid = generateGuid();

        // http://example.com + ?rnd= + {guid} + &name1=value1
        url = concat(url, kRandom, guid, query);

        // Create a cross-browse XmlHttpRequest.
        var xhr = createXhr();

        // Open the connection.
        xhr.open(verb, url, isAsync);

        // Add headers.
        addCommonRequestHeaders(xhr);

        if (isPost) {

            // Add more headers.
            addPostRequestHeaders(xhr);
        }

        // Register callbacks.
        registerCallbacks(xhr, callbacks);

        // Send the request.
        try {
            xhr.send(postQuery);
        } catch (exception) {
            callbacks.onexception(xhr, exception);
        }

        if (isSync) {

            // If the request is sync, process response immediately.
            processCallbacks(xhr, callbacks);
        }

        return xhr;

**DO NOT** insert blank lines...

* **After** the beginning of and **before** the ending of
**function**, **try**, **catch**, **finally**, **switch**, **if**, **else**,
**case**, **do**, and **while** blocks:

        // Incorrect:
        if (condition) {

            stuff();
            someOtherStuff();

        } else {

            anotherStuff();

        }

        // Correct:
        if (condition) {
            stuff();
            someOtherStuff();
        } else {
            anotherStuff();
        }

### Trailing Spaces And File Endings

* Trim trailing spaces in every source file.
* Put an extra blank line at the end of each source file.

### Brace Positioning

The brace positions should be as follows:

* **Same line**, in blocks (*C-Style*).

        for (var key in ar) {
            if (ar.hasOwnProperty(key)) {
                value = ar[key];

                if (shouldDeepCopy && ( typeof value == 'object')) {
                    theCopy[key] = me.CollectionHelper.copy(value,
                        shouldDeepCopy);

                    continue;
                }

                theCopy[key] = value;
            }
        }

* **Same line**, in function declarations (*C-Style*).

        removeElementByValue : function (collection, name, value,
                    isRecursive) {
            var item = null;
            var isNested = !!isRecursive;

            var removeElementByValue = o2.CollectionHelper.removeElementByValue;

            ...

* **Same line**, in switch statements (*C-Style*).

        switch (className) {
            case ccc.LOG:
                try {
                    console.log(text);
                } catch (ignore1) {
                }

                break;
            case ccc.INFO:
                try {
                    console.info(text);
                } catch (ignore2) {
                }

                break;

                ...

### Spaces

The spacing should be as follows:

* Commas: **before**: 0, **after**: 1
* Parentheses: **before**: 0, **after**: 0
* Semicolons in for statements: **before**: 0, **after**: 1
* Arithmetic operators: **before**: 1, **after**: 1
* Relational operators: **before**: 1, **after**: 1
* Unary (*++, --*) operators: **before**: 0, **after**: 0
* Assignments (**=**): **before**: 1, **after**: 1
* Conditional operators (**&&, ||**): before: 1, after: 1
* Key-value (*{'a':'b'}*) operators: **before**: 1, **after**: 1
* Inside a line comment: **after**: 1

        //this is incorrect

        // This is correct with a space.

* Negation: **after**: 0

        // Incorrect:
        if (! stuff && ! otherStuff) {
            doAction();
        }

        // Correct:
        if (!stuff && !otherStuff) {
            doAction();
        }

### New Lines

* **DO NOT** insert a new line *before* else statement.
* **DO NOT** insert a new line *before* if and else-if statement.
* **DO NOT** insert a new line *before* catch statement.
* **DO NOT** insert a new line *before* finally statement.
* **DO NOT** insert a new line *before* while in a do statement.
* **DO** insert a new line *before* ' name : value ' pairs.
* **DO** separate *logical code fragments* from each other *with a new line*.

Example:

    // Functions

    function foo() {

        ...

        do {
        } while(true);

        try {
            alert('hello');
        } catch (e) {
            ...
        } finally {
            ...
        }

    }

    function bar(a) {
        if (true) {
            return;
        }

        // If-Else

        if (false) {
            alert('hello');
        } else if (a > 0) {
            alert(a);
        } else {
            alert(0);
        }

    }

    // Switch-Case

    switch (a) {
        case 1:
            alert('1');

            break;
        case 2:

            break;
        default:
            alert('none');
    }

    // Closures

    (function fooInGroup(a, b) {

    }(a, b));

    // Associative Objects

    var associative = {
       name1: 'value1',
       name2: 'value2',
       name3: 10,

       //float is a keyword and thus it's escaped.
       'float': 'left
    };

### Always Use `var`

Variables in **JavaScript** either have **global scope** or **function scope**,
and using  the `var` keyword is vital to keeping them straight.

When declaring a variable for use either as a global variable or as a
function-level variable, always prefix the declaration with the `var` keyword.

### Feature-Detect Rather Than Browser-Detect

**DO NOT** write your code to detect browser versions and to take different
action  based on the user agent being used. This, most of the time, is a very
bad  practice. Any code which even looks at the global `navigator` object is
suspect.

The better approach is to use **feature detection**. That is, before using any
advanced feature that an older browser may not support, check to see if function
the or property exists first, then use it.

### `eval` is **evil**

The `eval()` function in **JavaScript** is a way to run arbitrary code at
run-time.

In almost all cases, eval should never be used. If it exists in your code,
there is almost always a more correct way to accomplish what you are doing.

Note that using `Function` constructor is also a form of `eval` and should be
avoided.

### Do not use `undefined`

In **JavaScript**, it is possible to override the `undefined` variable
unintentionally.

Consider the following case where the author of the code loves
[Yoda][23] conditions, but mistypes `=` instead of using `===`:

    if (undefined = getStuff()) {
        doStuff
    }

If `getStuff()` return some object (like `{success : true}`), all of a sudden
the `undefined` object gets a new definition:

    // this will log `true`.
    console.log( undefined.success )

to avoid this, **o2.j2** modules use an `UNDEFINED` parameter at the beginning
of the module decleration, and use `UNDEFINED` instead of `undefined` inside
the module. Here's an example:

    (function(framework, UNDEFINED) {
        'use strict';

        // module code goes here.

        if (foo === UNDEFINED) {
            bar();
        } else {
            baz();
        }
    }(this.o2);

This aliasing gives a slight minification advantage as well.

### **Object** and **Array** Creation

Use literal notation. It takes less space and it's sligthly faster:

    // Incorrect:
    var obj = new Object();
    var ar = new Array();

    // Correct:
    var obj = {};
    var ar = [];

### Strings

Use single quotes ( `'` ) for string literals.

Using double quotes (") for HTML attributes and single quotes (') for
**JavaScript** string literals will make writing HTML template code in
**JavaScript** easier.

Example:

    // Correct:
    var kImageTemplate = '<img src="picture.gif" width="4" height="4" />';

    // Incorrect:
    var test = "lorem ipsum dolor sit amet";

    // Correct:
    var test = 'lorem ipsum dolor sit amet';

### Comments

Use [jsDoc syntax][1] for documenting modules, functions, objects, and
structs.

* [jsDoc][1] references to method parameters shall be bold.

        * @throws Exception if <strong>fn</strong> callback is not defined.

* [jsDoc][1] **JavaScript** objects should be enclosed in `<code></code>`.

        * @param {DomNode} node - the DOM object (or its <code>String</code>.

Use **only** line comments ( `//` ) for in-line comments.
Do not use c-style comments (`/*..*/`) inside functions.
Use c-style comments (`/**/`) only for *documentation*.

Put your inline comments on top of the part that the comment is explaining:

This is correct:

    // Cache the global function.
    var fnDo = doStuff;

This is not:

    var fnDo = doStuff; // Cache the global function.

This is even worse:

    var fnDo = doStuff;
    // Cache the global function.

You **MUST** comment critical or tricky parts of the code, or important
changes you've made to the code, or anything that's not easy to grasp
at a first glance.

> Keep in mind that using, or having a need to use, lots of inline comments
> may be an indicator that you need to split your code into subroutines.

Feel free to **write descriptive comments**; your production **shall** be
*minified* and *obfuscated* anyway; and therefore your comments will not
have  any negative impact on *performance* or *file size*.

Use **full sentences** in both **documentation** and **inline** comments.
Start each comment with **capital** letter, and it with a **full stop** as
you'd do in a normal sentence.

    Incorrect:

        // sync request -- process response
        processCallbacks(xhr, callbacks);

    Correct:

        // If the request is sync, then process the response immediately.
        processCallbacks(xhr, callbacks);

### Variable and Method Naming

You are not a human code compiler/compressor, so don't try to be one.

* Use meaningful variable (and function) names:

        // Incorrect:
        var kSixteen = 16;

        // Better:
        var kNumberOfBits = 16;

* Use **long and descriptive** variable (*and function*) names.

    Trying to determine what a variable contains, or what a method does should
    be as straightforward as possible. It is an all too common practice to use
    abbreviations, single letters or seemingly random names for variables,
    functions and class names.

    Using abbreviated names doesn't make sense in almost any practical
    programming languages (and there are usually minifiers for those where
    it does). This should be **avoided at all costs**.

        // Incorrect:
        usrAvail = true;

        // Better:
        isUserAvailable = true;

* Assign aliases for complex conditionals. Consider
[replacing temp with query][24] in your variable assignments.

    For instance:

        if (
            person.getGender() === kMale && person.getAge() >= kValidAge &&
            person.getNationality() !== kDefaultNationality ||
            person.getGender() === kFemale && person.getAge < kValidAge &&
            person.getNationality() === kDefaultNationality
        ) {
            doStuff();
        }

    Can be better expressed as:

        var isMaleAlienWithValidAge = person.getGender() === kMale &&
            person.getAge() >= kValidAge &&
            person.getNationality() !== kDefaultNationality;

        var isFemaleCitizenWithInvalidAge = person.getGender() === kFemale &&
            person.getAge < kValidAge &&
            person.getNationality() === kDefaultNationality;

        if (isMaleAlienWithValidAge || isFemaleCitizenWithInvalidAge) {
            doStuff();
        }

    Or even better:

        function isEligibleToEnterTheParty(person) {
            var isMaleAlienWithValidAge = person.getGender() === kMale &&
                person.getAge() >= kValidAge &&
                person.getNationality() !== kDefaultNationality;

            var isFemaleCitizenWithInvalidAge = person.getGender() ===
                kFemale &&
                person.getAge < kValidAge &&
                person.getNationality() === kDefaultNationality;

            return isMaleAlienWithValidAge || isFemaleCitizenWithInvalidAge;
        }

        if (isEligibleToEnterTheParty(person)) {
            doStuff();
        }

* Establish a naming convention based on **real names** that mean something.

* Avoid any abbreviations unless they are part of your target industry's
every-day lingo.

* In method names, try to use a name that describes what the method
**really does**.

* Variables and classes should be **nouns** or **noun phrases**.

* Class names are like **collective nouns**.

* Variable names are like **proper nouns**.

* Procedure names should be **verbs** or **verb phrases**.

* Booleans should be **adjectives**.

* For compound names, retain conventional English syntax.

* Try to make names **pronounceable**.

* **Try to be obvious**.

* **DO NOT** override parameters.

        // Incorrect:
        function doStuff(target) {
            target = $(target); //<-- target parameter has now changed.
        }

        // Correct:
        function doStuff(targetElm) {
            var target = $(targetElm); // <-- safer: Original targetElm
                                       //            has not changed.
        }

* Choose readable variable names:

        // WTF?!
        var b001 = (lo == l0) ? (I1 == 11) : (lOl != 101);

* Use short enough and long enough variable names in each scope of code.

As a rule of thumb, length may be 1 char for loop counters, 1 word for
condition/loop variables, 1-2 words for methods, 2-3 words for classes,
3-4 words for globals.

* A variable name must define the exact explanation of its content.

* Don't use non-ASCII chars in variable names.

* **Do not use Hungarian Notation**:

        // Incorrect:
        var dblIncome = 100.12;

        // Correct -- no prefix:
        var income = 100.12;


    **Exception**:

    It's okay to prefix DOM elements with txt, btn and the like.
    But **be consistent** in your prefixes. (i.e. do not use
    *btnAction* and *lnkAction* for the same link button in different places)

        // These are all OK:
        var txtLogin = document.getElementById('loginInput');
        var btnAction = document.getElementById('submitForm');
        var optCountry = document.getElementById('countrySelection');

* Use **verbs** for **function names**.

Use meaningful names for methods. The name must specify the exact action of
the method and must start with a verb. (e.g. *createPasswordHash*)

* Use meaningful names for method parameters.

You should be able to understand what the parameter is for without
documentation. And this should **NOT** be an excuse for not having properly
documented code.

* Use **nouns** for **members**, **constants** and **variables**.

* Use **is**, **has**, **should**... prefixes for methods that return a
**boolean**.

        // Incorrect:

            // Status is a "noun".
            if (statusToState(user.status) == kLoggedIn) {
                userLogin(); // User is a "noun".
            }

            if (loggedIn()) {
                stuff();// Stuff is a "noun".
            }

            if (goToNextPage()) { // this method returns a boolean.
                nextPage(); // next is a "noun".
            }

        // Correct:

            if (mapUserStatusToState(user.status) == kLoggedIn) {
                logUserIn();
            }

            if (isLoggedIn) {
                doStuff();
            }

            if (shouldGoToNextPage()) {
                goToNextPage();
            }

* Use **singular** names for **namespaces**:

        // "member", not "members"
        var kFullName = config.constants.member.FULL_NAME


    **Exception**:

    One exception to this rule is the use of **constants** (*as above*),
    and **enums**, in order to differentiate them from *constant* and *enum*
    keywords.

* Use **plural** names for **collections**:

        var members = getOnlineMembers(); // "members", not "member".

* Use **camelCase** for **method names** and **member names**, use
**ALL_CAPS** for **constants**.

        function getUserInfo(){
        }

        function renderNewLoginForm(){
        }

        var config = {
            constants: {
                memberRegistrationStatus: {
                    REGISTERED: 3,
                    WAITING_APPROVAL: 1,
                    NOT_INITIALIZED: 0
                }
            }
        };

    **Exception**:

    Event-handler callbacks is an exception to this naming convention:

        var EventCallback = {
            // Not in camelCase.
            // Format: domobject_eventname (all lowercase)
            document_mousedown: function(evt){

            }
        };

        o2.addEventListener(document, 'mousedown',
            EventCallback.document_mousedown);

* Use **camelCase** for acronyms:

        config.constants.methodName.wcf.INSERT;// Correct

        config.constants.methodName.WCF.INSERT;// Incorrect

        getDOMNode() // Incorrect

        getDomNode() // Correct

        o2.StringHelper.htmlEncode() // Correct
        o2.StringHelper.HTMLEncode() // Incorrect

* Use **lowercase** for event handler references:

        // Incorrect:
        var onComplete = globalCompletionCallback || o2.nill;

        // Correct:
        var oncomplete = globalCompletionCallback || o2.nill;

* **Be consistent** in naming your methods; do not give different names to
two methods which are essentially doing the same thing.

**Summary:**

    variables, object, functions       : camelCase ( getStatusRecord() )
    private variables, private methods : camelCase
    public variables, public methods   : camelCase
    enums and global constants         : ALL_CAPS
    local/global constants             : prefix with k ( kPipeTimeout )
    Parameters                         : camelCase
    Objects and Constructors           : PascalCase
    Packages/Namespaces                : lowercase
    Methods                            : camelCase

Some more examples:

    // Local constant:
    var kActiveProvider = enums.ProviderType.TWITTER;

    // Do not start functions other than constructors with UpperCase.
    function user(){}
    var john = new user(); // incorrect

    function User(){}
    var john = new User(); // correct

    function GetAccountDetails(){} // incorrect
    function getAccountDetails(){} // correct

### Avoid Using the `continue` Statement

Avoid using `continue` statement. It tends to obscure the control flow of
the function.

    // Incorrect:
    for (i = 0; i < len, i++) {
        if (i === maxLength) {
            doAction();

            continue;
        }

        doStuff();
    }

    // Correct:
    for (i = 0; i < len, i++) {
        if (i === maxLength) {
            doAction();
        } else {
            doStuff();
        }
    }

### Return Early

Early returns promote code readability with negligible performance impact,
if any.

    // Instead of this:

    function returnLate(foo) {
        var ret;

        if (foo) {
            ret = 'foo';
        } else {
            ret = 'bar';
        }

        return ret;
    }

    // Do this:

    function returnEarly(foo) {
        if (foo) {
            return 'foo';
        }

        return 'bar';
    }

### Group Related Statements Together Using Parentheses (`( )`)

Although `&&` has precedence over `||`, mixing them together without grouping
may decrease readability.

    // Incorrect:
    return obj !== undefined && obj !== null && klass === type;

    // Correct:
    return (obj !== undefined) && (obj !== null) && (klass === type);

### Sort Variables and Methods in Alphabethical Order

Keep your variable declerations in alphabethical order:

    /*
     * EcmaScript Types
     */
    var kArguments = 'Arguments';
    var kArray     = 'Array';
    var kBoolean   = 'Boolean';
    var kDate      = 'Date';
    var kFunction  = 'Function';
    var kNumber    = 'Number';
    var kObject    = 'Object';
    var kRegExp    = 'RegExp';
    var kString    = 'String';

Also note that it's okay to align the `=` signs for better readability.

Method declerations are also ordered alphabethically inside the code.
Here's a section of **o2.Dom.traverse.js**. Note that the methods are declared
in alphabethical order from top to bottom:

    exports.getChildren = def(me, 'getChildren', function(elm, name) {
        return execFilter(elm, getChildNodes, [name]);
    })

    ...

    exports.getParentsByAttribute = def(me, 'getParentsByAttribute', function(
                elm, attribute, value, name) {
        return getParents(elm, isAttributeEquals, [attribute, value],
            null, [], name);
    });

    ...

    exports.isSibling = def(me, 'isSibling', function(elm, ref) {
        if (!ref) {
            return false;
        }

        return contains(getSiblings(ref), elm);
    });

Same is true for module definition **[JSDoc][1]** headers:

    /**
     * @module   unit.core
     * @requires core
     * @requires debugger.core
     * @requires domhelper.scroll
     * @requires stringhelper.core
     */

### Avoid "Yoda Conditions"

[Yoda][23] was a great teacher except for his word sequence.

**Yoda conditions** is basically using `if (constant === variable)` instead of
`if(variable == constant)`. Because it's like saying
"Much to learn, you still have."

The main reason of using **Yoda conditions**, is to avoid mistaken left hand
side assignments like `if (value = 42)` (instead of `if (value == 42)`).
However, [JSLint][2] already checks your code against these (and many other)
errors.

So you need not make your code harder to read. Avoid Yoda conditions and
integrate [JSLint][2] into your build process -- that's enough.

[23]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoda "Do, or do not -- there's no try."

Instead of this

    // if connected is result's status (harder to read and folow)
    if (CONNECTED === result.status) {
        ...
    }

do this

    // if result's status is connected (much easier)
    if (result.status === CONNECTED) {
        ...
    }

### Avoid **Stringly Typed** Code

Your code should not needlessly rely on **String**s, when there are programmer
and refactor friendly options are available:

For examples, pass numeric literals, or enums as method parameters, rather than
strings.

> Excessively **stringly typed** code is usually a pain to understand
> and detonates at production with errors that [JSLint][2] would normally find.

It is also darn hard to refactor a **stringly typed** codebase.
A starting point may be creating constants for commonly used string literals
and use those constants instead of the strings themselves.

### Always Use Strict Comparison

Strong-typed languages such as Java and C# considers two values to be equal
if and only if they are equal both by value and by type. **JavaScript** equality
operator (`==`), however, enables *type coercion* when comparing different types.
Although the rules of coercion are deterministic and strictly defined, the
issue creates some [confusion][20], at least.

          [0] == true   // gives true.
        !![0] == true   // gives true.
    'Samurai' == false  // gives false.
    'Samurai' == true   // gives false.

To avoid confusion and logic errors, always use strict equality and unequality
operators:

    // Incorrect:
    if (a == b && c != d) {
        doStuff();
    }

    // Correct:
    if (a === b && c !== d) {
        doStuff();
    }

### File, Folder and Path Naming

Use **lowercase** for *files*, *folders* and *paths*.

    // Incorrect:
    /wwwRoot/Script/mainController.js

    // Correct:
    /wwwroot/script/maincontroller.js

### File Headers

Each file (*module*) should have a descriptive header.
The *module* header should also be in [JSDoc Format][1].

    /**
     * @module domhelper.dimension
     * @requires domhelper.core
     *
     * <!--
     *  This program is distributed under
     *  the terms of the MIT license.
     *  Please see the LICENSE file for details.
     * -->
     *
     * <p>Includes dimension (<strong>i.e. width-height related</strong>)
     * helper methods.</p>
     */

### Curly Love

Use curly braces, even when they are not strictly necessary.

    // Which 'if' belongs to which 'else' ?!
    if (b1) if (b2) foo(); else bar();

    // This is better:
    if (b1) {
        if (b2) {
            foo();
        } else {
            bar();
        }
    }

    // Incorrect:
    function method() {
        for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
            if (i != 0)
                foo();
    }

    // Correct:
    function method() {
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            if (i != 0) {
                foo();
            }
        }
    }

### Function Headers

Each function decleration should have a documentation header. If the function
is publicly accessible it should have a [JSDoc][1] header; if the function is
private to the module it should also have a header.

Example:

    // private function:

    /*
     * Checks whether two nodes are equal to one another.
     */
    function isNodeEquals(node, until) {
        if (!node) {
            return false;
        }

        if (!until) {
            return false;
        }

        return $(node) === $(until);
    }

    // public function:

    /**
     * @function {protected static} o2.AjaxState.addObserver
     *
     * <p>An implementation of the <code>Observer.addObserver</code>
     * method.</p>
     * <p>Registers an <code>Observer</code>.</p>
     *
     * <p>This method is <strong>protected</strong>, in a sense that it's not
     * meant to be called directly. {@link o2.AjaxController} and
     * {@link o2.JsonpController} use it indirectly to register themselves.</p>
     *
     * @param {Object} observer - the <code>Observer</code> to register.
     */
    exports.addObserver = def(me, 'addObserver', function(observer) {

        //!
        // acquire(me, this, 'observer');
        if (hasObserver(this, observer)) {
            return;
        }

        var observers = getObservers(this);

        observers.push({
            object : observer,
            meta : {
                registrationTime : (new Date()).getTime(),
                timeout : (observer.timeout || null)
            }
        });
    });

### Default Fallbacks

All switch-case's should have a `default:` exit point.
That last fallback should at least have a log statement.

All if-else chains should have an `else` in the end.
That last else should at least have a log statement.

    if (answer == 'no') {
        alert('You said no');
    } else if (answer == 'yes') {
        alert('You said yes');
    } else {

        // This block should be here, even if we do not
        // care about any outcome other than 'yes' or 'no
        assert('I should not be here');
    }

**Exception**:

A single `if` statement may not be regarded as an if-else *"chain"*, so it's
okay to leave single if's without an else.

    if (controller.isLoadingTemplates()) {
        return;
    } /*else {
        log('controller has more templates');
    } -- not required -- */

### Boolean Comparisons

**DO NOT** directly compare with **true**, or **false**.

    // Incorrect:
    while(condition === false)

    // Incorrect:
    while(condition !== true)

    // You got the point:
    While(((condition === true) === true) === true)

    // Correct:
    while(condition)

### Variable Access

* **DO NOT** access the same variable more than once:

        v[i] = ++c;  // OK
        v[i] = ++i;  // Incorrect. Misleading.
        i = i + 1;   // OK
        i = ++i + 1; // Incorrect an unnecessary;
                     // i += 2 should have been better.

* Aim to minimize the scope of variables. Use as little global variables,
global configuration data, and global functions as possible.
Use **modules** and **namespaces** to achieve that.

### Statement Termination

Always terminate statements with a semicolon (`;`):

    // Incorrect:
    var i = 10

    // Correct:
    var i = 10;

    // Incorrect:
    var test = function() {
    }

    // Correct:
    var test = function() {
    };

### Variable Declerations

Declare every variable on a new line:

    // Incorrect:
    var a, b;

    // Correct.
    var a;
    var b;

## o2.js **JavaScript** Coding Best-practices

### JsLint Your Code

[JSLint][2] is a **must-have** great tool written in **JavaScript** that
allows you to validate your **JavaScript** code against a **strict** and
**rigorous** set of best practises.

Written by [Douglas Crockford][2] it is a must have for anyone keep theier
code-base *ship shape*.

[JSLint][2] your code to prevent bugs and surprises creep into it.

Automate the usage of **JsLint** by integrating, **JSLint** validation to your
web application's build & deployment cycle.

The version of **JSLint** used to validate **o2.js** modules can be found at:

    ./3rdparty/jslint/jslint.js

folder of this bundle.

The **JSLint** validation preferences used are as follows:

    "--indent", "4",
    "--space",
    "--newcap",
    "--undef",
    "--regexp",
    "--bitwise",
    "--white",
    "--node",
    "--plusplus",
    "--stupid",

### **Event Handler** Naming Convention

User **elementName_eventname** format for event handlers.

    function confirmButton_click(evt) {

    }

    functions masterContainer_readystatechange(evt) {

    }

    o2.EventHandler.addEventListener(
        tester,
        'readystatechange',
        tester_readystatechange
    );

    o2.EventHandler.addEventListener(
        confirmButton,
        'click',
        confirmButton_click
    );

The same convention is true for custom events:

    DemoWidget.oninit = demoWidget_init;

or

    DemoWidget.oninit = WidgetCallback.demoWidget_init;

When used as function pointers event handlers start with **on**,
and they are **all lowercase**.

    var ondocumentmousedown = EventCallback.document_mousedown;
    // or
    // var ondocumentmousedown = document_mousedown;

    ...

    ondocumentmousedown.apply(this, [evt]);

Any custom event also starts with **on** on and is **all lowercase**:

    var Selectable = function(params) {
        ... stuff ...

        // We register the handler on constructor.
        // Note that the assigned method name (this.onselectionchange)
        // and the parameter name (params.onselectionchange)
        // are both all lowercase.
        this.onselectionchange = params.onselectionchange;
    };

    Selectable.prototype.doSomeAction = function() {
        ...

        // Also note that we send the even source and additional event
        // arguments to the event handling delegate as parameters.
        // This is also a nice convention to stick with.
        this.onselectionchange.apply(this, [source, eventArgs]);
    };

    // Note that we still use **componentName_eventname** when we attach the
    // event handler to an **instance** of this object:
    var venueSelection = new Selectable({container : 'venueListDiv'});
    venueSelection.onselectionchange =
        WidgetCallback.venueSelection_selectionchange;

**Exception**:

Callbacks that cannot be correlated with a unique DOM node
or with a unique custom object (like **AJAX/JSONP/CORS...** async response
handlers), AND callbacks that are correlated with an **action** (verb)
(and not with an *object* (noun)) are **camelCased** and start with **handle**.

An example is better than a thousand words:

    // "user deletion" is an "action", not an "object", so its callback is
    // handleUserDeleteSuccess and NOT userDelete_success
    o2.Jsonp.get('api.php', {params}, ApiCallback.handleUserDeleteSuccess);

### Store Your Code in Meaningful Folder Structures

The naming conventions should also apply to your folders. Split up your code
in **logical groups** and store it in folders that describe
**what they contain**.

This will make it much easier to keep your code-tree organized and scale it
to thousands of files without hindering your ability to get to specific
files quickly.

* Group your source files in **logical groups**

* Keep your folder names **consistent** throughout the project.

* Use your naming convention recursively inside of your sub-folders.

### Show Love To the [Module Pattern][10]

[Modules][10] are simply self-executing function literals.
They create their own *private* **static** context, and encapsulate the
business logic inside. This will (*in theory*) enable developers safely write
their own code, without effecting the code that others have been developing.

**o2.js** files are organized in modules using the [module pattern][10].

Each o2.js module has the following basic structure.

    (function(framework, window) {

        ... module code goes here ...

    }(this.o2, this));

### Do Not Pollute The Global Namespace

**Avoid using public variables and public functions at all costs**.

Global variables and functions are rarely, if ever, required.

Using globals cause naming conflicts between **JavaScript** source files
and cause code  to break unexpectedly. For this reason, it is a good
practice to encapsulate functionality within *namespaces*.

### **Avoid** sync AJAX calls

When making AJAX requests, you may choose either async or sync mode. Async mode
runs the request in the background while other browser activities can continue
to process. Sync mode will wait for the request to return before continuing.

**Requests made with sync mode should be avoided**. These requests will cause
the browser to lock up for the user until the request returns. In cases where
the server is busy and the response takes a while, the user's browser will not
allow anything else to be done. In cases where a response is never properly
received, the browser may continue to block until the request is timed out.

If you think that your situation requires sync mode, it is most likely time to
re-think your design. Very few (if any) situations actually require AJAX
requests in sync mode.

### Use **JSON**

**JSON** (**JavaScript** Object Notation) is compact and efficient data
format, and is language-neutral.

When storing data structures as plain text or sending/retrieving data structures
via AJAX, use **JSON** (instead of XML or other formats) whenever possible.

### Use namespaces and break code into modules.

> Modules, *modules*, **modules**.
> **NOT**
> functions, *functions*, **functions**!

### Avoid God Objects And God Methods

Each method **SHOULD** have one, and only one, clearly defined task.
If a method is doing more than one thing, it should be **divided**
into **subroutines**.

Program your functions atomically. Aim to reduce [cyclomatic complexity][4].

While writing a method the following should be taken into consideration:

* The accepted input ranges, and data types,
* Return values and their meanings,
* Error conditions, exceptional cases, and how they are handled.
* Whether the method has any [side effects][5]

> A function with no side effects is a function that always returns the same
> value given the same arguments, and never changes the internal global state
> (MODEL), or the application's look & feel (VIEW). It takes some arguments,
> returns a value based on these arguments, and do not monkey around with
> anything else.

### Strive for harmony and symmetry in your code.

This is hard to demonstrate as it's more of a conceptual thing.

Let us try to explain it with a few bullet points:

* It should be easy to identify a method name, which folder a module resides in.
* It should take no more than a few seconds to identify where to write a
piece of code.
* If a module registers an object, that very same module should unregister it.

This intuition can only be gained in time, with patience and tireless practice.

> Use the force, and find harmony you will.

### **DO NOT** Rely On Type Information While Naming Variables

Strive **NOT TO** include type information in variables.

Variables should be understandable by their behavior (*semantics*),
**NOT** by their type.

    // Incorrect:

        var eventType = framework.EventType;
        var kAddBuddyEventType = eventType.ADD_BUDDY;

        var itemArrayList = new ArrayList();

    // Correct:

        /* eventType is an alias to type "framework.EventType" */
        var eventType = framework.EventType;

        /* kAddBuddy is of type "framework.Eventype"
           (when we think in non-strict terms) */
        var kAddBuddy = eventType.ADD_BUDDY;

        var items = new ArrayList();

Similarly don't start variables with o_, obj_, m_ etc. A variable does not
need tags which states it is a... well... "variable".

**Exception**:

If there are two similar constants, we may want to include type information
instead of renaming those constants, as in the following case:

    var kDomLoaded = 'domloaded';
    var kDomLoadedRegExp = /domloaded/g;

    var kUsername = 'user name';
    var kUsernameFieldId = 'txtUsername';

Also, if adding type information conveys an additional meaning which decreases
ambiguity, clarifies meaning, and makes the code easier to follow, its okay
to include type information in variable names. So use your own judgement.

Variable names for UI elements are generally examples for this:

    // It's not clear what "cancel" refers to. A method, a boolen flag?
    var cancel = document.getElementById('btnCancel');

    // this is better: more explanatory, easier to follow.
    var cancelButton = document.getElementById('btnCancel');

### Always Respect Type

**JavaScript** is a dynamically typed language - which can be your
best friend or worst enemy, so: Always respect type.

Always use equality with type ( `===` and `!==` ) when comparing
variables and statements.

If you know the type of an input variable beforehand explicitly cast
it before using it. Here's an example:

    var userCount = document.getElementById('uc').value;

    // 1. defensively parse the value using parseInt
    // 2. use === for comparison.
    if (parseInt(userCount, 10) === MAX_ALLOWED_USER_COUNT) {
        doStuff();
    }

    // Or...

    // The unary operator + will convert its rigth-side operand
    // into a number.
    if (+userCount === MAX_ALLOWED_USER_COUNT) {
        doStuff();
    }

### **DO NOT** Mix **HTML** and **JavaScript**

Use a templating engine. Don't mix **HTML** markup within **JavaScript** code.

### **DO NOT** Use Inlne **JavaScript** Events

Using inline **JavaScript** events and server-side templating (e.g. *Smarty*),
is a dangerous mix that may leave your code prone to **"script injection"**
attacks.

**Event overriding** is yet another reason to avoid using inline **JavaScript**
(i.e. `onclick=""`s). The way inline event handlers work is called
**"DOM Level 0 Events"**
(`<a href="javascript:void()" onclick="foo();return false">...</a>` ... yuck!).

The issue with DOM Level 0 events is that you can only assign one event
handler to a node, using them.  With [unobtrusive JavaScript][6] and
[behavioral separation][7] you actually assign event handlers to a higher
level (DOM Level 2 to be exact). This level allows for multiple event
handlers to be assigned to one event.

[behavioral separation][7], is actually far more than that, but that's the
topic of another story.

One of the big powers of **JavaScript** is that it comes in a seperate file.
Much like CSS, this means you can apply one collection of functions to
every page of the site, and if you need to change the functionality,
you can do that in one document rather than going through and replacing
each **onclick** event on every single template.

> Don't be a lazy `b****`, and **decouple** your **JavaScript**!

 **Coupling is bad**, and we know it.

* We **decouple** our data access from our views,
* We **decouple** our services from each other

We try to keep coupling to a minimum in every piece of code we write...
except our **JavaScript**.

Coupling of our **JavaScript** tto markup prevents you from changing your
markup without addressing your **JavaScript** as well.

In short;

* Separate **CSS** from **HTML** (no `<style></style>` tags, no `style=""`
attributes).
* Separate **JavaScript** from **HTML** (no `<script>...</script>`s, no
`onclick=""`s,
* no `onkeydown=""`s, or God forbid, no `href:"javascript:"`s ...)
* Separate **HTML** from **JavaScript** (no **HTML tagsoup** within
**JavaScript**; use **templates** instead)
* Separate **PHP** (or the server-side language of your choice) from
**JavaScript** (**PHP** should not spit out thousands of lines of
server-generated **JavaScript**)

### Use Event-delegation

**DO NOT** register every single click event, on every single object.

When there are large numbers of objects, which the application has to listen
and respond to, hanging around, adding an event handler to each and every
single one of those objects will have a **huge** impact on **performance** and
**memory utilization**.

Use [event delegation][8] instead.

[Event delegation][8] is **faster**, **scalable**, and **easier to maintain**.

### Use Event-driven Programming

Use [event-driven programming][9]. Web apps will **always** be event driven.

You're either responding to a **user event**, or a **system event**.

Architect and program your components as such.

### Avoid **Magic Strings** And **Magic Numbers** Like Plague

Use **symbolic constants** for **numeric literals** and **string literals**.

    // Incorrect:

    var j = 0;
    for(var i=0, len=52, i<len; i++){
        j = i + getRandomInt(53 - i) - 1;
        swapDeck(i, j);
    }

What if we wish to use a deck size of 114 (2 decks).
You can say that we can find/replace all "52"si with "114"s and
we're done. But even a mass find/replace will not be able to catch
the number 53 in the 3rd line, and it will pop-up as a logic error
which we will hardly be able to find out.

> The **rule-of-thumb** should be to store anything that's prone to change
> (**numbers**, **parameters**, **strings**) in either symbolic constants
> or in **shared static public configuration structs** as constant members.

Here's the correct way of doing the above deck shuffling:

    var kDeckSize = 52;
    var j = 0;

    for (var i=0, len=kDeckSize, i<len; i++){
        j = i + getRandomInt(kDeckSize + 1 - i) - 1;
        swapDeck(i, j);
    }

Moreover, if there's a relation between two symbolic constants, this
relation should be **explicitly indicated**:

    var kMaxItems = 32;
    var kHighWaterRank = (3 * kMaxItems) / 4; //instead of 24.

### Use Event Constants

Related to the above item, instead of using string literals for registering
events like

    listen(document, 'click', function(evt)) {
        ...
    });

prefer to use a event constant as follows:

    var kClick = 'click';

    ... other initialization ...

    listen(document, kClick, function(evt) {

    });

**Event constants** provide an easy way to refer to specific event types.
Using a constant instead of the String value helps us identify typographical
errors more quickly. If we misspell a constant name in our code, the
**JavaScript **parser will catch the mistake.

On the other hand, if we misspell the event String as in
`listen(document, ‘click1‘, function(evt) {`, the event handler will be
registered for a type of event that will never be dispatched (*i.e. "click1").
And we’ll spend hours of your development time, trying to debug what went wrong.

In addition to that, assigning commonly-used strings to constants will help in
**minification** and **obfuscation** of our **JavaScript** code.

### Decouple Objects and Minimize Variable Scope

Objects and methods should have as little information about each other
as possible. That's the major motivator behind **object-oriented programming*.

Minimize variable scopes. Use the [module pattern][10].

> The larger the scope of the variables, the harder it is to maintain the code.

*Avoid* global variables and global methods at all costs.

### Replace **Temporary Variables** with **Query Methods**

Chaining temp variables with query functions, **reduces** the number of
variables used in the code, and **decreases** the possibility to make an error.

This usage might have a slight performance impact, which can be overcome by [memoization][11].

Compare this:

    var basePrice = quantity * itemPrice;

    ...

    // base price can be overridden anywhere in the code.

    if (basePrice > 1000) {
        return basePrice * 0.95;
    } else {
        return basePrice * 0.98;
    }

against this:

    // Instead...

    function getBasePrice(){
        return quantity * itemPrice;
    }

    // There's no risk in overriding the base price.

    ...

    if (getBasePrice() > 1000) {
        return getBasePrice() * 0.95;
    } else {
        return getBasePrice() * 0.98;
    }

### Keep it **DRY**

> Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative
> representation within a system.

Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) is a principle of software development aimed at
reducing repetition of information of all kinds.

The principle has been formulated by Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas in their book
[The Pragmatic Programmer][25].

When the DRY principle is applied successfully, a modification of any single
element of a system does not require a change in other logically-unrelated
elements. Additionally, elements that are logically related all change
predictably and uniformly, and are thus kept in sync.

### Program Defensively

Adhere [defensive programming][12] best-practices.

All functions should work according to a given [contract][13].

Their **in/out parameters**, exepected and unexpected **value ranges**,
**side-effects**, **error** and **exception** situtaions etc. **SHALL**
be designed **before** writing the code.

Use [guard-clauses][14] to avoid unexpected conditions.
Return early, return often.

### **Exception**s Are For **Exceptional** Cases

Exceptions are expensive. Using a nested structure of `try/catch`s
will increase the depth of the execution scope, which may slow down your
code.

Throw exceptions only in exceptional cases.
If you know what's going on ("operation completed", "connection error",
"end of stream"... etc) use return codes instead of throwing exceptions.

Besides, hiding surprises inside `try { stuff() } catch (ignore){ }` kind
of constructs, will result in logic errors that are hard to find.

> `try/catch` != **CYA**

Use `try/catch`s only if there's something out of your control
(a plugin, a custom user code that's late-bound and delegated, a queue
structure where all the items should be processed even if some of the
items do generate errors).

These cases are rare and **exceptional**.

Functions shall not throw exceptions; they
should return meaningful error-codes instead.

#### **DO NOT** Manage Business Logic With Exceptions

This is a corollary to the above topic:

Don't manage business logic with exceptions. Use **conditional statements**
instead.

Each `try/catch` block comes with it's own scope of execution. And increasing
the depth of execution scope will make your application slower. If a control
can be done with if-else statement clearly (e.g. null control,
divide by zero control), don't use exceptions because it reduces performance and
readability.

#### **DO NOT** Ignore Exceptions

Don't absorb exceptions with no logging and operation.
That is to say, **do not** use something similar to this:

    try {
        doStuff();
    } catch(ignore) {
        // Do nothing, just ignore.
    }

Instead do this:

    try {
        doStuff();
    } catch(ignore) {
        log(ignore);
    }

There are *very* rare exceptions to this.
Here is a code from **o2.ajax.js** that does not log an exception on purpose:

    // In the below code sample, the flow exits after
    // the first successful initialization of the `request` object:

    while (progIds.length > 0) {
        progId = progIds.shift();

        try {
            request = new ActiveXObject(progId);

            break;
        } catch(ignore) {
        }
    }

    if (!request) {
        throw kNoXhr;
    }

99% of the time, your code is not *that* exceptional.

**Log your exceptions whenever you can**.

Ignoring exceptions will save that moment but will create a chaos for
maintainability later.

> When you do use `try/catch` blocks, remember to log the
> errors in `catch` and clean up state and resources in `finally`.

#### **DO NOT** Use `try/catch` Within Loops

This is a corollary to the above topic. Exception handling inside a loop is not
recommended for most cases. Surround the loop with a `try` block instead.

So instead of this:

    while(condition) {
        try {
            stuff();
        } catch(e) {
            log(e);
        }
    }

do this:

    try {
        while(condition) {
            stuff();
        }
    } catch(e) {
        log(e);
    }

#### Clearly Document Exceptional Cases

Produce enough [documentation][1] for your exceptions. Giving a **number/code**
for each different exception message is a good practice for
**ease of maintainance**.

#### Good Boys Clean Their Mess

When you use exceptions always clean up resources and perform this in `finally`
blocks.

Summary:

* `try { } catch { }` is an expensive construct in **JavaScript**.
* *DO NOT* use `try/catch`s within loops.
* *DO NOT* use nested `try/catch`es: Use one try-catch
at the topmost level.
* **AVOID** using `try/catch`es unless it's absolutely necessary.
* Always **clean up** & **deallocate** your resources & **reset** your state
in the `finally` block.

### Use The Force Wisely

Your application shall function degrade gracefully, when **JavaScript**
is not available or when **JavaScript** has been disabled.

**JavaScript** is for **enhancing** existing functionality.

[Enhance progressively][15], and ensure tha your application
is usable at all times.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Performance and Memory Considerations

Here are certain performance considerations, and guidelines to keep in mind
when designing a highly interactive, mostly single-page, client-heavy,
long-lasting (i.e. users will be on the same page for more than several hours)
web application:

### Key Performance Indicators

While coding try to **minimize** the following:

* **Vertical complexity**: How deeply nested the code is.
* **Horizontal complexity**: Number of lines per module/method.
* **Token count**
* **Variable count**
* **Loop count**
* **Conditional count** (i.e. if/else/switch count)
* **Variable scope**

Also note that using arrays excessively can degrade performance,
and leak memory.

To avoid memory leaks:

* **Use** the [delete operator][16] to deallocate members,
* **Avoid** [closures][17] between DOM World and the JS World,
* And **minimize** JS / DOM interaction.

### Consider Using **Native** Methods Whenever Possible

`for(...)` is around 3 times faster than, take for example, jQuery's
`$(this).each` (depending of the selector complexity, and the
collection size). There's no faster selector than
`document.getElementById()`. `Function.call` and `Function.apply`
are definitely faster than Prototype.js's `bind` method.

The fact that you have a framework at hand, does not mean you
should excessively use it. Know (and learn) adequate **JavaScript**,
to use native methods in performance-and-memory-critical
parts of your code.

### Minimize **Scope Chain** And **Namespace Lookup**

Instead of this...

    var lSide = collection.subcollection.items.all.left;
    var rSide = collection.subcollection.items.all.right;

Do this:

    var all = collection.subcollection.items.all;
    var lSide = all.left; /*each dot is a namespace lookup.*/
    var rSide = all.right;

Things get worse, if the **collection** variable above is a **DOM Node**
and the assignments are repeated in a `for` loop (both of which are not
uncommon situtations).

### Use **Array Joins** Instead Of String Concatenation

    // Instead of this...
    var result = 'a' + 'b' + 'c' + 'd';

    // This is much faster:
    var result = ['a','b','c','d'].join('');

### Use **Function Pointers**

Instead of this...

    function iterateOverMe(){
        for (var i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
            lorem.ipsum.dolor.sit(i);
        }
    }

This is much faster:

    function iterateOverMe() {
        var sit = lorem.ipsum.dolor.sit;

        for(var i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
            sit(i);
        }
    }

As a sidenote, the first time a **function** is declared is more
expensive than its consecutive declerations, because the initial
decleration both involves **namespace lookup** and **creation**;
while the latter only involves **creation**:

    //namespace lookup & creation;
    var fnPtr = lorem.ipsum.dolor.sit;

    //second decleration is faster -- just namespace lookup.
    var fnPtr2 = lorem.ipsum.dolor.sit;

The more you reduce namespace lookups, the faster is your code.

### Add Complex DOM Subtrees Offline

Instead of this:

    function tableTest() {
        var tableEl = null;
        var rowEl = null;
        var cellEl = null;
        var numRows = 10;
        var numCells = 5;

        tableEl = document.createElement('TABLE');
        tableEl = document.body.appendChild(tableEl);

        for (i = 0; i < numRows; i++) {
            rowEl = document.createElement('TR');

            for (j = 0; j < numCells;j++) {
                cellEl = document.createElement('TD');
                cellEl.appendChild(
                document.createTextNode('[row '+i+' cell '+j+ ']''));
                rowEl.appendChild(cellEl);
            }

            tableEl.appendChild(rowEl);
        }
    }

This is much faster:

    function tableTest() {
        var tableEl = null;
        var rowEl = null;
        var cellEl = null;
        var numRows = 10;
        var numCells = 5;

        tableEl = document.createElement('TABLE');

        for (i = 0; i < numRows; i++) {
            rowEl = document.createElement('TR');

            for (j = 0; j < numCells; j++) {
                cellEl = document.createElement('TD');
                cellEl.appendChild(document.createTextNode(
                [row +i+' cell '+j+ ']'));
                rowEl.appendChild(cellEl);
            }

            tableEl.appendChild(rowEl);
        }

        tableEl = document.body.appendChild(tableEl);
    }

### Edit Complex DOM Subtrees Offline

Instead of this...

    function subTrees() {
        var ul = document.getElementById('myUL');

        for (var i = 0; i < 200; i++) {
            ul.appendChild(document.createElement('LI'));
        }
    }

This is much faster:

    function subTrees(){
        var ul = document.getElementById('myUL');
        var li = document.createElement('LI');
        var parentNode = ul.parentNode;

        parentNode.removeChild(ul);

        for (var i = 0; i < 200; i++) {
            ul.appendChild(li.cloneNode(true));
        }

        parentNode.appendChild(ul);
    }

### Cache DOM Collection Length

Instead of this...

    function nodeJam(){
        nodes = document.getElementsByTagName('P');

        for (var i = 0; i < nodes.length; i++) {
            nodes[i].innerHTML += 'test';
        }
    }

This is faster:

    function nodeJam(){
        nodes = document.getElementsByTagName('P');

        for (var i = 0, len = nodes.length; i < len; i++) {
            nodes[i].innerHTML += 'test';
        }
    }

### Use Memoization for Computation-Intensive Functions

If your functions are deterministic, you can use [memoization][19],
so that you don't need to do the same computations over and over again.

### Cache Frequently Used Global Methods And Objects For Speed

Last, but not the least, **always cache** global methods and object that you
use within loops:

So instead of this...

    function loopMePlease(){
        for (var i=0; i<1000; i++) {
            doStuff();

            if (n===12) {
                someBlock();
            } else if (n===26) {
                someOtherBlock();
            }
        }

    }

This is faster:

    function loopMePlease(){

        // Cache the global function.
        var fnDo = doStuff;

        for(var i=0; i<1000; i++){
            fnDo();

            // Also, a switch/case is (negligibly) faster
            // than an if-else chain
            switch(n){
                case 12:
                    someBlock();
                    break;
                case 26:
                    someOtherBlock();
                    break;
            }
        }
    }

Also it's a good practice to **cache DOM object collections**,
because executing the same selectors over and over again
to reach the same collection is resource intensive.

> The less you mess up with DOM, the better.

Instead of this...

    select('div > li > a').show();
    select('div > li > a').addClass('test');
    select('div > li > a').click(function(){});

This is much faster:

    var collection = select('div > li > a');

    collection.show();
    collection.addClass('test');
    collection.click(function(){});

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Code Smells

Constantly follow these indicators, as they often show the quality
(or lack thereof) of the code you're writing.

### Comments

There's a slight difference between comments that are explaining
what's being done and comments that are overly confusing.

Comments should answer the question **"why?"**, not the question **"what?"** or
**how?**.

If the number of "caveat" comments inside a code block is increasing,
it may show that the code block is becoming more complicated.

If possible, the code should be refactored, so that those "caveat"
comments are not necessary anymore.

Instead of explaining when to use comments, it would be better to show when
not to use comments:

* Comments are **NOT** for stating the obvious:

        // Set the value of cache.
        cache = value;

    Another example of stating the obvious:

        while(doStuff()) {
            // Do nothing.
            ;
        }

* Comments are **NOT** for helping reader learn the language:

        // Iterate through collection:
        for(var key in collection) {
            // If the collection really has a property `key`...
            if(collection.hasOwnProperty(key)) {
                // Store the value into the cache.
                cache[key] = collection[key];
            }
        }

**JavaScript** is the common denominator between the reader and the author.
There are many references the reader can refer to to learn **JavaScript** --
let them do that. Assume that the reader knows **JavaScript** and let the code
clearly describe **HOW**.

Use of comments is often a form of religion; people are very opinionated about
them in one way or another. [Robert Martin][23] expresses his opionion in
[Clean Code][22] by saying:

> The proper use of comments is to compensate for our failure to express
> yourself in code. Note that I used the word failure. I meant it.
> **Comments are always failures**.

Robert Martin had previous described comments as **apologies** for
**making the code unmaintainable**.

* Any comment is better than no comment at all

None the less comments **are** an integral part of the code, so they are really
important.

A commentless code library will be useless in a short time with
high probability. Even though there are approaches that suggest
self-explanatory code over documentation, you should use both
(self-explanatory code AND documentation).

* Use comments "as required".

Unnecessary over-commenting in each line will reduce readability.
Whereas lack of commenting will increase maintenance time.

* Writie comments (e.g. **[JsDoc][1]** declaration) for all public methods.

* Comment HACKS and TODO's while you are writing the code.

Document "gotcha"s and "todo"s instantly when detected. These items may be
remembered for that instant but may not for tomorrow when not documented.

Heck, do you remember what you ate for lunch 3 days ago? So don't be lazy
and write those inline comments.

### Excessively Long Method Names

Explanatory method names are good.

Keeping everything constant, a shorter method name is easier to read and
understand. Method names should be shortened, without losing their
meanings. Method names should be shorter enough, but not too sort.

Besides a very long method name may be the indicator of a
**God Function**, which should be avoided anyway.

If your function is named `doThisAndThatAndSomethingElse`, most probably
you can split it into `doThis`, `doThat`, and `doSomethingElse` parts.

### Methods Having Too Much Parameters

* The more parameters a method has, the more complex it is.
* The more complex a method is, the more possible that it has more than
one functionality.
* The more functionality a method has, the closer it is to a **God Function**.

And God Functions are bad.

If a method has too much parameters:

* Either reduce the number of method parameters,
* Or merge those parameters under a configuration object.

### Code Repetition (Copy & Paste Code)

Seeing the same code over and over again is a clear indication of low code
quality.

Repeating code, should be consolidated in **helper methods**. If the code
is duplicated in different modules, then **a new helper module** should be
created and both of the modules should the the new module's helper
method instead.

### Conditional Complexity

If the code has a lot of `if/else` chains, nested `for`s `switch`es etc and
it makes it harder to read the code; then it's time to **refactor** it.

### Codes Doing "almost" the Same Thing

Codes doing almost the same thing should be regarded as code repetition,
and should be **refactored** accordingly.

### A Very Large Module / Function

If a module has grown too large, then it's most probably doing more than
it's supposed to do.

If you have a swiss army knife module, then it's time to split it into
sub-modules to make your code more manageable and less error prone.

### Function And Variables That Are Not Telling What They Do

Or worse, functions that are giving a message that's totally unrelated to what
they do.

Let's say we have a fictitious "executeIframeAjaxProxy" method which neither
uses an iframe, nor makes an ajax call, and is not a proxy to something.
It's not uncommon to see these badly-named methods, if the project is
more than a few years old.

Those methods should immediately be **renamed*, in order to relieve the
frustration that the next poor developer working on the code will have.
Otherwise she'll be spending hours of valuable development time to figure out
what the code does, or worse she'll be using the code with incorrect
assumptions out of hassle.

If a method has a misleading name, **rename it**.

### Incoherent Naming

> Don't look at the thesaurus,
> and use a different synonym of "get" each time
> you use a getter metod.
> You are not a linguist, you are a "developer".
> And part of your job is to give **boring**
> and **consistent** names to your methods.

Have a standard terminology in naming your methods and adhere to it.

Do not give different names to similar-behaving functions.

Here are a few examples:

* **createFoo** : deterministic outcome.
* **generateFoo** : Probabilistic outcome.
* **renderFoo** : A complex visual change, usually involving some extra logic
to decide what to render.
* **showFoo/hideFoo** : a simpler visual change
* **processFoo/doFoo** : a batch (Façade) method that does several sub-tasks
together.
* **getFoo** : gets a (usually primitive) value
* **setFoo** : sets a (usually primitive) value

### Dead Code

If there's a code that's not working and not used anywhere; it should
be removed from the code-base immediately. Fear is the enemy of code
stability.

### Speculative Generalization

> Optimization without measurement is merely a waste of time.

Do not try to solve the problem of 5 months later, now.

First create a running prototype. Then test, optimize and benchmark
your code.

### "I Did It, and It Worked" Style Of Approach

If you've solved a problem, you should clearly understand
**why** and **how** you did it.

> For instance if a parameter is happening to be "null" then adding an
> "if not null" control is equivalent to sweeping the dust under the rug.

If the parameter is null or undefined, then you should find out
**"why"** it's that way.

If you devise a solution without going to the bottom of the problem;
sooner or later your so-called "solution" will stab you in the back.

### Temporary Variables

The more temporary variables in the code, the harder to manage it.
Temporary variables should be replaced with query methods when possible.

### Global Variables

The more the number of global state variables in the code, the more
dependent the modules are. And dependency means error-prone, and
hard-to-manage code.

### Data Clusters

If you observe certain kind of data, variables, method etc, loosely
lumping together in various parts of the code; then may be its better
to take them and create a separate class.

### Cross-Module-Intimacy

Modules should now the least information possible about each other.
Modules' public interface should be kept at a minimum.

**If you don't have a reason to keep a method public, than you had better
make that method private.**

### Attribute Envy

If some methods of module A calls a lot of methods from module B, then
may be those methods of module A should actually belong to module B.
Consider a refactoring.

### Lazy Class

Any newly added class, adds to the complexity of the project. If a class
is unable to hold its weight, i.e. it's not used enough, then it should
be merged with other classes.

### Shotgun Surgery

If adding a single line of code, or extracting a single method requires
changes in tens of unrelated methods and classes then the code needs
some serious refactoring.

### Incomplete Library Class

The method should belong to a library, but it's currently the private
method of an unrelated class. This is a **clear invitation to code
repetition** in other classes.

The method should be taken out of the class and put into a library.

### Existence of Incomplete Code Blocks

**Never check-in incomplete/untested code**.

The source code in the repository, at any given time, **SHOULD NOT** contain
any build errors, syntax errors, runtime errors, or logic errors.

This is only possible if **DO NOT** check-in garbage code.

The Source Code Repository is not your FTP backup place.

Only check in the code that you've **tested** (yes testing is *your*
responsibility) and you are %100 sure that it works.

Keep in mind that the checked in code should be "ready for release"
**at any time**.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Conflicting Situations

Even the strictest set of rules and coventions may be vague under certain
boundary conditions. Although coding has a lot of science and rules behind it,
it is also a form of *art*.

To take this one step further, we'll consider code more like a *poem*, than a
*newspaper article*. **Use your own judgement** for the vague boundary cases.
It's your **art**, more than anybody else's.

While using your judgmenet though, keep in mind that this document is mainly
based on [K&R Style Coding][21]. So you can safely follow [K&R Indent Style][21]
for situations that are not covered in this document.
