# TODO: for the test runner.

0. The runner should read the meta information in o2.meta.js.
1. For each module in the meta information the runner should load the
corresponding spec file.
    Example:
        for 'o2.dom.dimension' load '<testfolder>o2.dom.dimension.test.html'
2. Continuing with the dom.dimension example;
    o2.dom.dimension.test.html should include a /suite/o2.dom.dimension.js

3. Once the suite is loaded the RUNNER should check that the suite has
    apropriate test methods defined, by looking at its meta information.
    
    In our case test methods should exist for the following items:

            'getDimension', 'getDocumentDimension', 'getDocumentHeight',
            'getDocumentWidth', 'getHeight', 'getViewportInfo',
            'getWidth', 'getWindowInnerDimension', 'getWindowInnerHeight',
            'getWindowInnerWidth', 'setDimension', 'setHeight', 'setWidth'

    The runner (parent.Runner) will validate this by 

    3.1. checking that the suite has registered itself 
        (the suite should call `parent.Runner.addObserver(Suite)` for the check
        to succeed. and the suite should also provide an `update` method
        so that the parent runner can tell it to 'run' if everything is okay
        or send an error message if there's a problem.
        )

    3.2. the runner should test the existence of
        Suite.tests.getDimension ... etc.

        and if all the tests are present it should send a green light to
        the observer to continue to what it's doing.
